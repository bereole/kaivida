# kaivida
The new commit includes full admin features on the product section
That is ( creation of product, editing, deleting, updating, uploading picture, category)
Its left with the managing of orders( that is; editing orders and recieving as well as manippulating orders)
And also Managing Users( listing them and having control over their account)
Then we move to invoice
Then Participant system.
NB: Please make sure you create an empty folder in main kaivida folder, its part of the code that makes the image upload possible.
During uploading to the server we might use AWS services instead ofthe folder.
Thank you!
